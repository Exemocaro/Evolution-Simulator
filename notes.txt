The map:
    // - it's enclosed by walls
    // - can contain walls in the middle of it, to divide the map in sections.
    - will have the "cell"s, or beings, which move around it, and can not go through walls.
    - food. These will spawn regularly and give energy to each being that eats it.

The "cell"s:
    - represent a single-celled organism. It consists of:
        - a small neural network inside that will guide its behaviour.
        - a genome that determines how that neural network, or brain, works. (the NN weights, basically)
        - an "energy" value. The cell dies if its energy reaches 0.
        - an orientation value, representing where the cell is turned to, in degrees.
    Also have a position (x and y), but they aren't aware of it (it's not a sensory input in its network)
    They're represented by a color according to its energy value.

Neural networks:
    The inputs consist of "sensory" values that represent information about the environment near it, as well as values from the cell itself
    The outputs consist of "action"s or "function"s the cell can do.
    Each output is a number between 0 and 1. The activation functions are a tanh.

//The genome:
//    Controls the weights between the input and the output neurons.
//    Each gene equals one weight.

Cell Actions:
    - Each cell can do the following actions, represented by an output neuron in its brain:
        - rotate clockwise
        - rotate counter clockwise
        - move (to its current orientation).
    
Cell Sensory values:
    - Each cell will pass the following into the neural network. You can consider each as its own "sense".
        - its energy value
        - its orientation value (the angle)
        - 3 vision neurons, one in the front of it, the other 2 to the sides. These are 30 degrees to each side (value can be changed).
            - the value represents the distance to the nearest object/thing/cell
        - 3 respective neurons indicating what's in its vision neurons.
            //- a 0 would be a wall, 
            - a 1 would be a food source
            - a -1 represents nothing, when the cell can't "see".

Mechanics:
    The map:
        Shows the cells and the food //, and the walls.
        Toggleable cells' vision "lines".
        Ability to select a cell to inspect it.
    Cell behaviour:
        Cells can rotate and move according to their value in the output neurons.
        Each time they move, they lose some energy. The more they move, the more they lose energy (some log function)
        // When they hit a wall, they stop. They can't go over walls.
        When they hit a food source, they "eat" it and get some energy.
        When they hit another cell, nothing happens, (for now they can go over each other).
        When they die, they disappear from the map (for now, maybe I'll change it later)
    Simulation behaviour:
        Each simulation/generation will be run for an X amount of seconds.
        When the simulation ends, the cells that are alive (or the ones that survived the most) will get their genome copied, and it will be used on the next generation
        After each generation, a small mutation will be applied to the cells' genomes.
        After each simulation round, some logs need to be displayed.
